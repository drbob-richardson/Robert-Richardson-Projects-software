## Software Development and Usage

While the underlying code for several of my projects is proprietary, the methods and published outcomes are fully documented.  
Below are representative examples where my software and modeling work has been deployed or cited in real-world systems.

### 1. Rapid Detection of Biological Threats
**Project:** Implementation of decision-tree algorithms in C++ for field-deployable biological detection devices.  
**Publication:** [Analytical Chemistry, 84(1): 328–335 (2012)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ac202606x?casa_token=HMz2CLZrMwUAAAAA%3AIpRyOHSkYccjrv4G14LWYFFI00FLs-aOprq2NXYbO9EI-frnsYGsvvzv50p0rJSnuIJM4yBKMrf35mgT)  
**Impact:** Integrated by engineering teams for real-time signal classification in portable detection units used by field scientists.

### 3. Pharmaceutical Dissolution Modeling
**Project:** R package development for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of dissolution profiles.  
**Package:** [**BayesDissolution** on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesDissolution/index.html)  
**Publication:** [JRSS C (2022), 71(2): 331–352](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/article/71/2/331/7033968)  
**Impact:** Adopted by **Genentech** and currently petitioned to the **FDA** for regulatory submission use.

### 4. Network Security and QNAME Minimization
**Project:** Algorithms and statistical software for quantifying information leakage in DNS protocols.  
**Publication:** [IEEE (2024) — *Quantifying the Effect of QNAME Minimization on Network Security*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11192453)  
**Status:** Patent pending on the underlying methods and software implementation.
